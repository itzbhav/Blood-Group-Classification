🧬 Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprint
About the Project
This project focuses on predicting a person's blood group from their fingerprint image using deep learning techniques. It offers a non-invasive, quick, and innovative method compared to traditional blood tests, with potential applications in healthcare, forensics, and identity verification.

🧠 Models Used
AlexNet (alexnet.py)

LeNet (lenet.py)

MobileNetV2 (mobilevnet.py)

ResNet (Resnet.ipynb)

Among these, ResNet demonstrated the best overall performance based on evaluation results.

🚀 Highlights
Fine-tuning with transfer learning

Optimizers: Adam, SGD

Learning rate scheduling and early stopping to avoid overfitting
