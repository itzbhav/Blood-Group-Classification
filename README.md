ðŸ§¬ Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprint
This project aims to predict a person's blood group using fingerprint images through deep learning models. Instead of traditional blood tests, this approach offers a non-invasive and fast method by analyzing fingerprint patterns. It is designed for potential use in medical emergencies, forensic investigations, and identity verification.

Models Used:

AlexNet (implemented in alexnet.py)

LeNet (implemented in lenet.py)

MobileNetV2 (implemented in mobilevnet.py)

ResNet (implemented in Resnet.ipynb)

Among these, ResNet achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.
